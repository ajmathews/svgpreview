# svgpreview

This VSCode extension provides easy preview for SVG files.

## options
To have a slightly better svg preview experience one may set the workspace setting
"svgpreview.singletonmode" to true. This will change the behaviour of the SVG preview 
to always show the last opened svg file as content.
